        A QuadTile is a hierarchical grid used for geo-data storage and indexing.
        The world map is divided into 4 quadrants. Then, the quadrant that  contains the point is chosen.
        This is then done recursively

        This is being packaged as a 64-bit integer, where the even bits represent the latitude of the point
        and the odd bits represent the longitude of a point.

        For each level of zoom, it is seen to what quadrant the point belongs to.
        The y coordinate of the quadrant is stored in the second-to-last bit,
        and the x coordinate of the point is stored as the last bit.

        This is then left-shifted by two bits, and done recursively.

        This allows for a max zoom level of 31, due to the usage of a signed 64-bit
        integer, meaning the most significant bit cannot be used.
